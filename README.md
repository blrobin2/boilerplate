# CQRS Example

## Synopsis
Attempt at implementation of Greg Young's SimpleCQRS in JavaScript

## Installation
Clone down the repo, then run `npm install`.

## Motivation
I like [CQRS](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html), and I wanted to see if I could implement some of the patterns in JavaScript. [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) is a more JavaScript-y version of CQRS, but I wanted to try and get as close as possible to what [Greg Young](http://codebetter.com/gregyoung/) wrote, for better or worse.

## Usage
To compile TypeScript, run `npm run build`.

## Contributors
I know very little about TypeScript, so if you have an idea for better typing or implementation details, please fork!

## Prior Art
[gregoryyoung/m-r](https://github.com/gregoryyoung/m-r) The original version of this, written in C#.
